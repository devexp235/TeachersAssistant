                Ensure that you register an account with a specific email during the login process. Once that is done, you can start using the application.
            </p>
            <p>Having registered, your teacher will be notified, and you will be placed in a role as Student. Thereafter all communication and booking time with the Tutor and managing work will be done via the app. Please do not share your passwords. If you feel your password has been compromised, then we suggest you to reset it, during Login.</p>
